# Welcome to Android_REST_ImageDisplayApp

This is an app I made to practice REST API's in android moble app development. I utilize the Picsum.com's API to grab 
images and populate them in my app. In addition I use SqlLite and SQL commands to store image URI's that I inflate using the picasso library. 

## How to run this project:
To open, please clone this repo, create a new android studio project, copy over the directories to your new project,
refactor the package name and manifest.
